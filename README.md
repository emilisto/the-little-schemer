# What?

My code doodles from reading [The Little
Schemer](http://www.amazon.com/The-Little-Schemer-4th-Edition/dp/0262560992.)

I use mit-scheme to run the examples, and read the reference manuals on
and off:

- http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/documentation/mit-scheme-ref.pdf
- http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/documentation/mit-scheme-user.pdf

I try to not look too much at what's out there - since I want to learn
Scheme the way it once was, in the hope that it will give me a good
entry-path to different Lisps.

I use Emacs.
