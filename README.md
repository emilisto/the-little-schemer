# What?

My code doodles from reading [The Little
Schemer](http://www.amazon.com/The-Little-Schemer-4th-Edition/dp/0262560992.)

I try to not look too much at what's out there - since I want to learn
Scheme the way it once was, in the hope that it will give me a good
grasp of the origins of Lisp and life in general.

- I use [mit-scheme](http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/) to run the examples, and read the reference manuals on
and off:

  - http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/documentation/mit-scheme-ref.pdf
  - http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/documentation/mit-scheme-user.pdf

- I use Emacs, set up through the
[guiding](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/emacs.html) of the great Clojure people.

__TODO__: make a super-dumb guide to getting setup and able to run the
examples using Emacs and mit-scheme. It took me a few hours to get
comfortable, and I'd love to get people started in 5 min - discovering
this wonderful language.

## Good to knows

- `(ge (make-top-level-environment))` to clear the REPL environment
